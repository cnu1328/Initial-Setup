To create the React project in the master branch and push it to the GitHub repository, you can follow these steps based on the instructions provided by your project manager. Since the repository is currently empty, let's recreate and initialize the project correctly:

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to your working directory:**
   Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```

2. **Create a new React project:**
   Use the `npx create-react-app` command to set up the project:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app shape-fit-marketing-site --template typescript
   ```

3. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd shape-fit-marketing-site
   ```

4. **Remove any existing git history:**
   Since you're initializing a new git repository, remove the `.git` folder from `create-react-app`:

   ```bash
   rm -rf .git
   ```

5. **Initialize a new git repository:**
   Initialize a fresh Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

6. **Add the remote repository:**
   Link your local repository to the GitHub repository (use SSH or HTTPS based on your GitHub setup). In your case, it's already given as an SSH URL:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:shapefitio/shape-fit-marketing-site.git
   ```

7. **Add all files:**
   Stage all the files for the first commit:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

8. **Rename the default branch to master:**
   By default, many repositories use `main` as the branch name, but if you want `master`, you can rename it:

   ```bash
   git branch -M master
   ```

9. **Commit the changes:**
   Create the initial commit:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "first commit"
   ```

10. **Push to the master branch:**
    Finally, push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```

#### After this, your React project should be initialized, committed, and pushed to the `master` branch in the GitHub repository. If your repository was empty, it should now contain the React project files.

The error you're encountering is related to SSH authentication. It usually happens when Git can't authenticate using the SSH key you've set up for GitHub. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

### Steps to resolve:

1. **Check if you have an SSH key:**
   First, verify if you have an SSH key already generated:

   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```

   This will list all the SSH keys in the directory. Look for files like `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`. If no keys are listed, you'll need to generate one.

2. **Generate an SSH key (if not present):**
   If you don't have an SSH key, generate a new one using the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   If your system doesn't support `ed25519`, you can use:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   Follow the prompts and press Enter to accept the default file location. When asked for a passphrase, you can either set one or leave it blank.

3. **Add your SSH key to the SSH agent:**
   Start the SSH agent and add your key to it:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

4. **Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:**
   Copy your public SSH key to your clipboard:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   Copy the output of this command (your public key).

   - Go to your GitHub account, then to **Settings > SSH and GPG keys**.
   - Click on **New SSH key**, give it a title (e.g., "My Computer SSH Key"), and paste the public key into the key field.
   - Click **Add SSH key**.

5. **Test your SSH connection:**
   Check if your SSH connection to GitHub is working:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   You should see a message like this:

   ```
   Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

6. **Retry pushing your changes:**
   Now, try to push your changes again:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

This should resolve your issue with permission denied (publickey). If the problem persists, make sure you're using the correct SSH key that is associated with your GitHub account.
